Static S3 directory listing generator

Generates static directory listings for Amazon S3 buckets. This will help to save some ¢ if your
bucket is not too big (1 LIST call per 1000 items in the bucket if I recall correctly), you have or
want to have public directory listings and expect them to be used more than you update your bucket.

i.e. This works if you update your bucket with nightly compiler releases and you expect more than 0
visits per day to the listing.

This doesn’t work if you update your bucket every minute with 10s of thousands of user image
uploads and want to have up-to-date directory listing too.

Currently generates listings for a single bucket only.

config.toml contains all switches you can pull and all the buttons you can push to change how this
thing works. Each switch or button is self-documenting or is documented.

Requires:

* Python >3.2, I think
* boto (from pypi) (pip install boto)
* toml (from pypi) (pip install toml)

Also run generator.py --help
